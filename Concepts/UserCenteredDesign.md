# 🧭 User-Centered Design (UCD) in XR

## 🧠 What is UCD?

**User-Centered Design (UCD)** is a design philosophy and iterative process that keeps the user’s needs, limitations, context, and feedback at the core of every stage of development. In XR, this means designing **with** the user—not just *for* the user—while acknowledging the **physical, cognitive, and sensory challenges** that come with immersive environments.

## 🔄 UCD Process (ISO 9241-210 Model)

| Stage                | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Understand**   | Research user context, tasks, goals, physical conditions                    |
| **2. Specify**      | Define usability & immersion requirements based on that understanding       |
| **3. Design**       | Build interactive prototypes & experiences addressing real-world context     |
| **4. Evaluate**     | Test designs early and often with actual users to identify breakdowns       |
| *(Iterate)*         | Repeat steps based on findings—UCD is a **loop**, not a line                |

## 🎯 Why UCD Is Critical in XR

- **Embodiment matters**: Comfort, fatigue, motion sickness, and posture are physical UX factors.
- **Perceptual load**: Users can become overwhelmed quickly if not guided properly (visual + auditory + input cues).
- **Natural interaction**: Designs must match intuitive real-world gestures and expectations.
- **Emotion & trust**: A VR user must *feel safe*, *in control*, and *able to exit* gracefully.

## 💡 XR-Specific UCD Tips

- Prototype **in VR**, not just on paper
- Observe body posture, gaze, and hand gestures in early tests
- Simplify UI: avoid clutter, limit text, use familiar metaphors
- Account for **comfort zones** (safe physical ranges for movement and viewing)
- Test with *first-time* users to reveal real issues

## ✍️ My Reflections

- **Surprised by**: How much UCD in VR depends on *physical comfort* and *motion flow*, not just visual interface.
- **I want to try**: Building early, incomplete VR UIs and asking someone to test just the menu flow or comfort of hand movements.
- **Seen in Unity**: The gaze-based selection and teleportation feel natural—showing that thoughtful user-centered decisions are already embedded.
