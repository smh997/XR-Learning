# ðŸ§  AR/VR Concept Summaries

This repository contains my evolving summaries of key AR/VR concepts as I study immersive technologies, user-centered design, and simulation systems. Each `.md` file is a standalone learning artifact with definitions, implications, and personal reflections.

## ðŸ“š Concept Index
