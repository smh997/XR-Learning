🎯 Summary: Presence in Virtual Reality (VR)
Presence is the psychological state of "being there" in a virtual environment. It depends on both system performance and user perception.

🧠 Key System Factors That Support Presence:
Field of View (FOV): ≥ 80°

Display Resolution: 1080p or higher

Pixel Persistence: ≤ 3 ms (reduces motion blur)

Refresh Rate: > 60 Hz (95+ ideal for comfort)

Global Illumination: All pixels lit simultaneously (vs. rolling shutter)

Optics: Low distortion lenses; ideally ≤ 2 per eye

Optical Calibration: For accurate depth and stereoscopic rendering

Tracking Accuracy:

Position: millimeter accuracy

Orientation: ≤ 0.25°

Tracking Volume: at least 1.5m³

Latency:

Motion to last photon: ≤ 20–25 ms

🛠️ Presence is broken by:
Lag or jitter

Narrow FOV

Poor alignment or drift

Inconsistent sensory input (e.g., delayed haptics or mismatched visuals)

🌍 Presence is enhanced by:
Accurate motion tracking

Responsive, low-latency feedback

Stable viewpoint

High realism and consistency in interaction and feedback
